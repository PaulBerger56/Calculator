Calculator Project for The Odin Project

This project is the capstone project for The Odin Project's fundamentals section.  The entire calculator is built by me with minimal instructions from the project.  It is used as a way to make sure the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Javascript are strong enough to complete a full operational calculator.
